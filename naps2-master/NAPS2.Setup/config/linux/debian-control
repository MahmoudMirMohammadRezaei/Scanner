Description: Scan documents to PDF and more, as simply as possible.
 NAPS2 on Linux allows you to scan from USB (using SANE) and network scanners. Use your chosen settings, or
 set up multiple profiles for different devices and configurations. Once you've finished scanning, you can
 save, email, or print with only a couple clicks. Save to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, or other file types.
 .
 Easily rotate, crop, and rearrange scanned pages. Adjust brightness, contrast, and apply automatic document
 corrections to make your scanned pages look great. Use OCR to add searchable text to your PDFs in any of
 over 100 languages. Use batch scanning, advanced profile settings, and an optional CLI to automate tedious
 tasks.
